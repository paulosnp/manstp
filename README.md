## How can I deploy this project?

This project is configured to automatically deploy to GitHub Pages.

### Deployment to GitHub Pages

This project includes a GitHub Actions workflow that automatically builds and deploys the application to GitHub Pages whenever you push to the `main` branch.

To make the deployment work, you need to add the following secrets to your GitHub repository:

1.  **`VITE_SUPABASE_URL`**: Your Supabase project URL.
2.  **`VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`**: Your Supabase project's `anon` key.

You can add these secrets by going to your repository's **Settings**, then navigating to **Secrets and variables** > **Actions** and clicking **New repository secret** for each of the keys above.

Once the secrets are set up, your application will be deployed automatically on the next push to the `main` branch.

## Can I connect a custom domain to my Lovable project?
